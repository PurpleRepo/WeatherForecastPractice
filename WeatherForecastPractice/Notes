This app is meant to be an example for the MVVM architectural design pattern.

*** Currently always loads the cities list from scratch when going to add city view controller.
    - Should cache the list.
*** Need to get the unix date and display respective days for weather in 5 day forecast.
*** Need to change the api call to strictly 5 day so that when changing to the 5 day forecast ViewController, it will not make the call there and wait for it to load.
*** Need to store city ID's and load them upon starting the app.
*** Need to download icon images.
*** Need to use Kingfisher for loading the images from the web.
*** Need to fix the formatting of city name strings to catch spaces for URL's.

Wish to change the app to striclty employ the use of the SearchBarController for listing the cities in the PreferredCitiesViewController.


    Would like to display the minimum, maximum and current temperature for the forecast for each day in the 5 day forecast.

Temperature is listed in Kelvin by default. (ADDED "&units=imperial" to remedy this.)
Formula to Fahrenheit: (<X>°F − 32) × 5/9 + 273.15 = <Y>°K

5 Day 3 Hour Forecast (8 Forecasts/Day -> 40 Forecasts; 0...39)

@CitiesListViewController.swift
    -> When adding a city (rowSelectedAt), does not check to see if the PreferredCitiesWeatherViewController has it listed already.
@ProfileManager.swift
    -> Does not import profile (saved city ID's).
    -> Does not save profile (preferred city ID's).

Currently, a 5 day report fetches 40 individual forecasts.
    This information could be displayed as an animation along with a slider for the time of day and a Play/Pause button.
